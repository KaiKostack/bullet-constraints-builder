EGSidxPrio = 23   # Connection Priority      | Changes the connection priority for this element group which will override that the weaker breaking threshold of two elements is preferred for an connection. Lower Strength Priority has similar functionality but works on all groups, however, it is ignored if the priority here is different for a particular connection.

EGSidxAsst = 19   # Formula Assistant        | Material specific formula assistant with related settings
EGSidxCyln = 20   # Cylindrical Shape        | Interpret connection area as round instead of rectangular (ar = a *pi/4). This can be useful when you have to deal with cylindrical columns.
EGSidxIter = 28   # Const. Solver Iterations | Overrides the Constraint Solver Iterations value of the scene for constraints of this element group if set to a value greater 0. Higher numbers can help to reduce solver induced deformation on elements bearing extreme loads.
EGSidxDClP = 29   # Dis. Col. Permanently    | Disables collisions between initially connected elements of this element group permanently (overrides global setting).
# !!! Last ID: 35 !!! (Can be different from above line because list is not in order!)
# To add further element group variables add them here but also above in the presets at the correct index.
